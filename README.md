There are many "errors" in this movie selection application. For instance, if you refresh the page when you've navigated to a specific movie to see detailed information about it, you will no longer be able to see details about the movie but instead will get an error message "Movie not found".

I created this movie selection app for two reasons. These are 1. for practice, and 2. to show competence with Redux state management as well as handling 3rd-party API data fetching. There are certainly many things that could be improved with this app. But I believe the two goals of the project have been achieved nonetheless. It would entail a reduction of efficiency to divert attention to other tasks than the specific ones that were set out as criteria for project completion initially.
